## Part 1 - Offline Multiplayer Game

1. What type of multiplayer game was it?
    - The offline multiplayer game I decided to play was <i>Settlers of Catan</i>, a resource management board game that's played with up to four players.

2. What part of the games were you most drawn to?
    - <i>Settlers of Catan</i> draws me in the most when all players are familiar with the rules of the game and their own strategies of how to be the first to reach 12 points (offical rules say 10 points, but family rules set it to 12). Many of your decisions affect the other players around you, and it's neccessary to keep track of what other players are doing to play around them for your own strategy to succeed. The board itself is customizable, with the board pieces being seperated into simple hexagonal 'puzzle pieces' that can be switched out and moved around easily, making the game replayable with different outcomes every time. The difficulty of the game comes mainly from the oppenents you play against; and how well your strategy plays around the other players.

3. What types of information must be saved along the way?
    - 

4. Did you have to depend on the other player?  If so, in what capacity and how did they help you?
