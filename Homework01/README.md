# Homework1 Assignment and Questions

This is the Homework1 Assignment and my answers to the assigned questions

## Part 1 - Offline Multiplayer Game

1. What type of multiplayer game was it?

    - The offline multiplayer game I decided to play was <i>'Settlers of Catan'</i>, a resource management board game that's played with up to four players.

2. What part of the games were you most drawn to?

    - <i>'Settlers of Catan'</i> draws me in the most when all players are familiar with the rules of the game and their own strategies of how to be the first to reach 12 points (offical rules say 10 points, but family rules set it to 12). Many of your decisions affect the other players around you, and it's neccessary to keep track of what other players are doing to play around them for your own strategy to succeed. The board itself is customizable, with the board pieces being seperated into simple hexagonal 'puzzle pieces' that can be switched out and moved around easily, making the game replayable with different outcomes every time. The difficulty of the game comes mainly from the oppenents you play against; and how well your strategy plays around the other players.

3. What types of information must be saved along the way?

    - In <i>Settlers of Catan'</i>, the main information are the resource cards you receive upon rolling a number that your settlement is sitting next to on the board. These resources cards are then traded in specific hands for resources that give you Victory points. One example of this rule is a settlement requires you to trade in four resource cards: a sheep, brick, wood, and wheat resource cards. You must also keep track of where settlements are placed on the board, not only because a settlment gives you resources every time you roll the corresponding number to the tiles it stands next to, but settlements also have to all be at least two road lengths apart from each other, meaning if a player builds on the tile you want, you cannot build right next to that settlement and have to build around it. Managing your resource cards and building settlements that give you access to more resources are the main aspect to the game, however there are also other trades you can make to gain victory points, all requiring different combinations of resoruce cards to trade for. 

4. Did you have to depend on the other player?  If so, in what capacity and how did they help you?

    - The other players are the opposition you play against in this game, however trading with these players is also part of the gameplay and listed in the official ruleset of <i>'Settlers of Catan'</i>. Especially in the early game, your strategy might heavily depend on diplomacy with trading with other players for resources that you cannot get to just yet. An example is if I have 3 out of the 4 resource cards I need to make a new settlement, however I haven't rolled a number that gives me a wood resource card to complete the set. I can offer to trade with another player, offering them something in return for their wood resource card. The other player can decide wether they want to trade or not; even barter for a better trade deal for their resource card. Usually, a trade will go through if both players get a resource that they need for their strategies; random trading isn't efficient as having too many resource cards can be a hinderance on the player due to other gameplay aspects and rules. As the other player is also your opposition, it's just as much as a strategy to purposefully block a player from receiving a resource, and even being able to steal resources from other players with certain gameplay tactics.

## Part 2 - Online Multiplayer Game

1. What type of multiplayer game was it?

    - The online multiplayer game I used for this assignment is the multiplayer gameplay within the game <i>'Elden Ring'</i>. While the game itself is primarily a single player game, there is online multiplayer gameplay, and it is an incredibly interesting gameplay addition that adds to the experience of the single player playstyle.

2. What part of the games were you most drawn to?

    - As <i>'Elden Ring'</i> is open-world, the co-op feature in the game allows you to explore and fight together with your friends. Eldin Ring also takes into account the fact that two players are in the same world however; in a co-op session, enemies and bosses are more difficult to deal with than if you were fighting them in single player mode. Some of these changes are simply health boosts or the groups of enemies being larger, however bosses also gain their own buffs in order for the fight to be more difficult to fight against. I find this especially interesting, as it offers a way for players to play together while not allowing multi-player parties steam roll through the game's challenges. 

3. What types of information must be saved along the way?

    - Co-op sessions in <i>'Elden Ring'</i> don't have to fight over rewards as the game is set in a way where both players will receive the same reward, however there is a restriction to where the players can go in the world. The way the multiplayer works is a Host player will set up the multiplayer session, and then the other players join in the Host's world, being called 'Phantoms'. The "Phantom' Players cannot leave the Host's location up to a certain amount of feet, and if the Host is defeated, will be taken with the Host to the last 'checkpoint' they encountered. In this way, the Host generally has to make sure that they don't get overwhelmed by enemies, as the Phantom's ability to fight hinges on the Host staying alive and within the battle area.

4. Did you have to depend on the other player?  If so, in what capacity and how did they help you?
    - As mentioned in Question 3, 'Phantom' players rely on the Host staying alive in order to fight bosses and explore the world. Both the Phantom and the Host also need to work as a team to defeat bosses effieciently, as also stated before, bosses during co-op sessions receive buffs to make them even more difficult to counter-act having to fight more than one player. While the strategy of blindly going into a battle and fight to survive can work, co-op sessions usually include communication of what combat items (weapons, healing items, etc.) each player is bringing into a fight, and also communication of combat actions during a fight in order to manage the boss fight itself. As the Host's survival is important for the Phantoms to stay in the fight, a fighting tactic can include a Phantom player drawing the boss's attention away from the Host so that they can heal or apply more buffs to themselves before re-entering the fight.
